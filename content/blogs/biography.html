<h3>1. Before the dawn of time</h3>
<p>I was born on 21/10/2000 in Brussels. I was raised in Brussels by a Belgian dad and a French mother. My hobbies were <strong>swimming</strong> and <strong>reading</strong>. Although my family speaks french, I’ve always been to dutch schools. Therefore I spoke two different languages at a very young age.</p>

<h3>2. Undergrad</h3>
<p>I did my undergrad at <strong>KU Leuven</strong> in Belgium. I studied Business Engineering in <em>Dutch</em>. My three favorite courses in order of preference were:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Python: software programming</li>
<li>Corporate Finance</li>
<li>Mathematics</li>
</ol>
<p>During the last semester of my Bachelor I had the opportunity to follow a semester abroad for my Erasmus. This led me to live in Rome for the duration of 6 months. There, I made a lot of friends, partied and to my mother’s regret, didn’t study once <em>:’(</em>.</p>

<h3>3. Le Wagon and intership at AB-InBev</h3>
<p>After finishing my undergrad I decided to take a gap year to focus on what I wanted to afterwards. Therefore, I followed an intensive data science bootcamp at le Wagon in Paris. During this boot camp I learned a lot about <strong>Data Analytics</strong>, <strong>Machine Learnin</strong>, <strong>Deep Learning</strong> and <strong>Data Engineering</strong>.</p>
<p>To continue on a data-oriented path, I decided to an internship in Data Science at AB-InBev. I was fortunate to be surrounded by an amazing team and I learned a lot of things. At the end of my internship, I wrote a causal model about the relationship between Secondary Displays and Beer Sale in points of consumption in Germany.</p>

<h3>4. LBS</h3>
<p>This leads me to the final part of my first 21 (almost 22) years. After realising that I really liked working with data, I decided to follow the masters in Management and Analytics at LBS.</p>
