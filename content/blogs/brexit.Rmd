```{r load-libraries,include=FALSE, cache = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)  # Load ggplot2, dplyr, and all the other tidyverse packages
library(mosaic)
library(ggthemes)

## Introduction to the data

```{r setup, include=FALSE}

brexit_results <- read_csv(here::here("data","brexit_results.csv"))
```

Let's analyse at first what the data is all about: 

```{r brexit, include=TRUE, cache = FALSE}
glimpse(brexit_results)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
